# steph_surry-shots

For this project, I am using a dataset with all Steph Curry's NBA field goal attempts from October 2009 through June 2019 (regular season and playoffs). The dataset was collected with the nba_api Python library.

I will be creating a model to predict whether Curry will make a shot based on his past perfomance.
